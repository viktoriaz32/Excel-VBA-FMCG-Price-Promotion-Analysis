## Business question definition
The key business questions are defined in order to clarify the commercial objectives of the analysis and ensure all subsequent work remains aligned with decision-making needs and value delivery. The FMCG company requires a deep understanding of how pricing, promotions, and competitive dynamics influence sales and margin performance, therefore pricing decisions, promotional planning, and resource allocation can be made more effectively.

### Key Business Questions:

**1. Price sensitivity:** How do changes in price affect sales volume, revenue, and margin across different products and store segments?<br>
**2. Promotion effectiveness:** To what extent do promotions generate incremental demand versus merely shifting existing sales?<br>
**3. Profitability of promotions:** Which promotional campaigns drive positive margin contribution, and which result in margin erosion?<br>
**4. Promotion ROI:** What is the return on investment (ROI) of promotional activities when comparing incremental sales to promotional costs?<br>
**5. Competitive price positioning:** How do our price levels compare to competitor offerings, and how does this positioning influence customer purchasing behavior?<br>
**6. Media and marketing influence:** What role does media or marketing support play in amplifying or moderating the effects of pricing and promotional activities?
